          <h2>More About Yiping</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Yiping Dong, currently a BFA student in the Creative Technology path of the major Design and Technology, with
            minors of Communication Design and Moving Image Art at Parsons School of Design of The New School. 
            I am interested in many different kinds of  
            work, including but not limited to websites, games, 
            animations, and films.
            <p>
            I also do some fan arts in my spare time, usually in video editing format, which I have 180k+ times of playing on Bilibili.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am from Beijing, China, but I came to the US to study in middle school, so I can say that I grew up in two different cultures, both of which have a great influence on my work. Because I have been studying in the US for the most time, my professional techniques and theories are heavily influenced by Americans. However, the childhood influence that Chinese culture gave me rooted in my aesthetic. 
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúBe healthy‚Äù and ‚Äúbe happy everyday‚Äù are the most common things I say when I am asked to give wishes to others. Having people who are experiencing the torment of depression in my family, some of them changed dramatically both physically and mentally because of this imperceptible suffering really makes me think of what can I do. I found life is usually hard and repetitive, but I always appreciate the smallest of pleasant moments. It could be as small as somebody holding the door for me when I have both of my hands occupied or telling a joke during the break of a long day of work. I don‚Äôt like talking about people‚Äôs pain or showing the trauma in my heart to resonate with others, just let me tell a joke. I believe a cute little joke can make you smile for at least that moment. I also believe in ‚Äúputting people first‚Äù when I am doing design. I hope my design adds to the user‚Äôs joy with a nicely designed interface and won‚Äôt put them in a panic trying to figure out how to navigate around. I hope no one gets extra difficulties in their life.

I work in many media, they are mostly interactive pieces. The base of my design projects are always usability, then I add some warmth to it. I hope the experience is fluent and attractive. If you get sick of it, just have fun, it is all I aim for. For my graphic designs and drawings, I don‚Äôt always want to impress people, but I want my audience to be pleased and find it comfortable to look at. While I hope to impress them, I am more concerned with the audiences finding my work relaxing and pleasant to look at. I also make some films and animations. I don‚Äôt set the goal of having the deepest story, but if it makes my audience smile, it is a good piece according to me. The fun could be from the graphic, the picture, or maybe just something idiotic happened. I always hope my audience can appreciate my humor, that is my goal when I try to tell a story.</p>
<p>
Keep a smile on your face, try not to get overwhelmed by stress, nothing is unacceptable. </p>
<p>Be happy, be healthy.</p>
<p>My best wishes.
