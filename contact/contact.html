          <h2>More About Yiping</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Yiping Dong, currently a BFA student in the Creative Technology path of the major Design and Technology, with a
            minor of Moving Image Art at Parsons School of Design of The New School. 
            I like games a lot, but I still chose CT because I don't want to limit myself in games, and I think that is a great decision.
            I am interested in many different kinds of work, including but not limited to websites, animations and videos. 
            There are still a lot more software and working methods for me to explore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am from Beijing, China, but I came to South Carolina to study in middle school, 
            so I can say that I grew up in two different cultures, both of which have a great influence on my work. 
            Also, I believe that we should enjoy our life no matter how busy, it is important to find a method of stress relief.
            I also think that it is necessary to take every detail of life and to appreciate it, no matter what the feeling is at the moment. 
            These are things I really like to embed into my work. I have done a lot of works inspired by daily life, 
            because I want my audience to find more happy moments in their life, no matter what culture they come from.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also do some fan arts in my spare time, usurally in video editing format, which I have 180k+ times of playing on Bilibili.
