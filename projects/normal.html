	<p>In this film, I am discussing the idea of "what is normal".</p>
	<p>People always judge others based on their own standards, and a lot of them don't accept any challenge.</p>
	<p>This piece is originally from my own experience of "hating the sun while living close to the beach" and developed more when I saw the news of  the Chinese government banning the LGBTQ social media accounts. </p>
	<br>
	<p>I wrote the story and the script all by myself, also directed, shot most of it, and was on camera myself. </p>
	<p>It wasn't easy to design all the shots, take care of the camera, and act all by myself, but that is what I have to challenge myself on in the scenario of taking classes online during the pandemic. <br>

	<p>It is a special experience of producing a short film almost without any help from others and only using cell phones as cameras.</p>
	<p>It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot during the progress.</p>
	<br>
	<p>A huge thanks to my friend Milin for helping me as a cinematographer on some shots! </p>
